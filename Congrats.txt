
It is good to hear from you Viscount.
I am very happy to hear of your accomplishments in the forbidden cave.
I have heard many tales of your name, widespread across the entire kingdom.
You will be rewarded with many fortunes upon your return.
Also, I believe the title of Marquess is no longer fit for you.
Rather, I welcome you into the new world, Marquess.
